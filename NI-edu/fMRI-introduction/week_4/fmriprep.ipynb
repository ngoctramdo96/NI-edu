    "# Fmriprep\n",
    "Today, many excellent general-purpose, open-source neuroimaging software packages exist: [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) (Matlab-based), [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki), [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/), and [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) (with a shell interface). We argue that there is not one single package that is always the best choice for every step in your preprocessing pipeline. Fortunately, people from the [Poldrack lab](https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/) created [fmriprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a software package that offers a preprocessing pipeline which \"glues together\" functionality from different neuroimaging software packages (such as Freesurfer and FSL), such that each step in the pipeline is executed by the software package that (arguably) does it best.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been using *Fmriprep* for preprocessing of our own data and we strongly recommend it. It is relatively simple to use, requires minimal user intervention, and creates extensive visual reports for users to do visual quality control (to check whether each step in the pipeline worked as expected). The *only* requirement to use Fmriprep is that your data is formatted as specified in the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)."

    "## The BIDS-format\n",
    "[BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) is a specification on how to format, name, and organize your MRI dataset. It specifies the file format of MRI files (i.e., compressed Nifti: `.nii.gz` files), lays out rules for how you should name your files (i.e., with \"key-value\" pairs, such as: `sub-01_ses-1_task-1back_run-1_bold.nii.gz`), and outlines the file/folder structure of your dataset (where each subject has its own directory with separate subdirectories for different MRI modalities, including fieldmaps, functional, diffusion, and anatomical MRI). Additionally, it specifies a way to include \"metadata\" about the (MRI) files in your dataset with [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files: plain-text files with key-value pairs (in the form \"parameter: value\"). Given that your dataset is BIDS-formatted and contains the necessary metadata, you can use `fmriprep` on your dataset. (You can use the awesome [bids-validator](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/) to see whether your dataset is completely valid according to BIDS.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different tools to convert your \"raw\" scanner data (e.g., in DICOM or PAR/REC format) to BIDS, including [heudiconv](https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [bidscoin](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin), and [bidsify](https://github.com/NILAB-UvA/bidsify) (created by Lukas). We'll skip over this step and assume that you'll be able to convert your data to BIDS."

    "## Installing Fmriprep\n",
    "Now, having your data in BIDS is an important step in getting started with Fmriprep. The next step is installing the package. Technically, Fmriprep is a Python package, so it can be installed as such (using `pip install fmriprep`), but we do not recommend this \"bare metal\" installation, because it depends on a host of neuroimaging software packages (including FSL, Freesurfer, AFNI, and ANTs). So if you'd want to directly install Fmriprep, you'd need to install those extra neuroimaging software packages as well (which is not worth your time, trust us).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Fmriprep also offers a \"Docker container\" in which Fmriprep and all the associated dependencies are already installed. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is software that allows you to create \"containers\", which are like lightweight \"virtual machines\" ([VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)) that are like a separate (Linux-based) operating system with a specific software configuration. You can download the Fmriprep-specific docker \"image\", which is like a \"recipe\", build the Fmriprep-specific \"container\" according to this \"recipe\" on your computer, and finally use this container to run Fmriprep on your computer as if all dependencies were actually installed on your computer! Docker is available on Linux, Mac, and Windows. To install Docker, google something like \"install docker for {Windows,Mac,Linux}\" to find a google walkthrough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you need administrator (\"root\") privilege on your computer (which is likely the case for your own computer, but not on shared analysis servers) to run Docker. If you don't have root access on your computer/server, ask you administrator/sysadmin to install [singularity](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#singularity-container), which allows you to convert Docker images to Singularity images, which you can run without administrator privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have installed Docker, you can run the \"containerized\" Fmriprep from your command line directly, which involves a fairly long and complicated command (i.e., `docker run -it --rm -v bids_dir /data ... etc`), or using the `fmriprep-docker` Python package. This `fmriprep-docker` package is just a simple wrapper around the appropriate Docker command to run the complicated \"containerized\" Fmriprep command. We strongly recommend this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install `fmriprep-docker`, you can use `pip` (from your command line):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install fmriprep-docker\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you should have access to the `fmriprep-docker` command on your command line and you're ready to start preprocessing your dataset. For more detailed information about installing Fmriprep, check out their [website](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)."

    "## Running Fmriprep\n",
    "Assuming you have Docker and `fmriprep-docker` installed, you're ready to run Fmriprep. The basic format of the `fmriprep-docker` command is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that `fmriprep-docker` has two mandatory positional arguments: the first one being your BIDS-folder (i.e., the path to your folder with BIDS-formattefd data), and the second one being the output-folder (i.e., where you want Fmriprep to output the preprocessed data). We recommend setting your output-folder to a subfolder of your BIDS-folder named \"derivatives\": `<your bids-folder>/derivatives`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can add a bunch of extra \"flags\" (parameters) to the command to specify the preprocessing pipeline as you like it. We highlight a couple of important ones here, but for the full list of parameters, check out the [Fmriprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Freesurfer\n",
    "When running Fmriprep from Docker, you don't need to have Freesurfer installed, but you *do* need a Freesurfer license. You can download this here: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/License. Then, you need to supply the `--fs-license-file <path to license file>` parameter to your `fmriprep-docker` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --fs-license-file /home/lukas/license.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring what is preprocessed\n",
    "If you just run Fmriprep with the mandatory BIDS-folder and output-folder arguments, it will preprocess everything it finds in the BIDS-folder. Sometimes, however, you may just want to run one (or several) specific participants, or one (or more) specific tasks (e.g., only the MRI files associated with the localizer runs, but not the working memory runs). You can do this by adding the `--participant` and `--task` flags to the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --participant sub-01 --task localizer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify some things to be ignored during preprocessing using the `--ignore` parameters (like `fieldmaps`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --ignore fieldmaps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling performance\n",
    "It's very easy to parallelize the preprocessing pipeline by setting the `--nthreads` and `--omp-nthreads` parameters, which refer to the number of threads that should be used to run Fmriprep on. Note that laptops usually have 4 threads available (but analysis servers usually have more!). You can also specify the maximum of RAM that Fmriprep is allowed to use by the `--mem_mb` parameters. So, if you for example want to run Fmriprep with 3 threads and a maximum of 3GB of RAM, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --nthreads 3 --omp-nthreads 3 --mem_mb 3000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our experience, however, specifying the `--mem_mb` parameter is rarely necessary if you don't parallelize too much. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Output spaces\n",
    "Specifying your \"output spaces\" (with the `--output-spaces` flag) tells Fmriprep to what \"space(s)\" you want your preprocessed data registered to. For example, you can specify `T1w` to have your functional data registered to the participant's T1 scan. You can, instead or in addition to, also specify some standard template, like the MNI template (`MNI152NLin2009cAsym` or `MNI152NLin6Asym`). You can even specify surface templates if you want (like `fsaverage`), which will sample your volumetric functional data onto the surface (as computed by freesurfer). In addition to the specific output space(s), you can add a resolution \"modifier\" to the parameter to specify in what spatial resolution you want your resampled data to be. Without any resolution modifier, the native resolution of your functional files (e.g., $3\\times3\\times3$ mm.) will be kept intact. But if you want to upsample your resampled files to 2mm, you can add `YourTemplate:2mm`. For example, if you want to use the FSL-style MNI template (`MNI152NLin6Asym`) resampled at 2 mm, you'd use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:2mm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can of course specify multiple output-spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fmriprep-docker <your bids-folder> <your output-folder> --output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:2mm T1w fsaverage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other parameters\n",
    "There are many options that you can set when running Fmriprep. Check out the [Fmriprep website](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/) (under \"Usage\") for a list of all options!"
